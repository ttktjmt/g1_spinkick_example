# mjlab example: Unitree G1 Double Spin Kick

![Sim-to-real double spin kick comparison](assets/teaser.gif)

An example of building on top of [mjlab](https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab) to
teach a Unitree G1 humanoid to perform a **double spin kick**. The reference
motion comes from Jason Peng's [MimicKit](https://github.com/xbpeng/MimicKit).

**This repository provides:**
- Data conversion script (MimicKit pkl → mjlab csv)
- Full training results and hyperparameters
- Pretrained ONNX checkpoint for deployment
- Deployment instructions for real hardware

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mujocolab/g1_spinkick_example.git && cd g1_spinkick_example
uv sync
```

## Data Conversion

Download the spin kick data using the link referenced in the MimicKit
[installation instructions](https://github.com/xbpeng/MimicKit?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

The conversion script adds smooth transitions from a safe standing pose at the
start and end of the motion to ensure safe deployment. Since the motion is
cyclic, we also repeat it to reach the desired duration.

```bash
# Convert pkl to csv
uv run pkl_to_csv.py \
    --pkl-file g1_spinkick.pkl \
    --csv-file g1_spinkick.csv \
    --duration 2.65 \
    --add-start-transition \
    --add-end-transition \
    --transition-duration 0.5 \
    --pad-duration 1.0

# Convert csv to npz
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run -m mjlab.scripts.csv_to_npz \
    --input-file g1_spinkick.csv \
    --output-name mimickit_spinkick_safe \
    --input-fps 60 \
    --output-fps 50 \
    --render
```

This will upload the motion to your wandb registry and create a video showing
the reference motion like the one below:

## Training

Follow the registry creation instructions in the mjlab
[README](https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab?tab=readme-ov-file#2-motion-imitation).

```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 uv run train \
    Mjlab-Spinkick-Unitree-G1 \
    --registry-name {your-organization}/{registry-name}/mimickit_spinkick_safe \
    --env.scene.num-envs 4096 \
    --agent.max-iterations 20_000
```

For full training details and reproducibility, see the
[wandb report](https://api.wandb.ai/links/gcbc_researchers/nfi58457).

## Evaluation

To evaluate your trained policy, you'll need your wandb run path. You can find
this in the run overview. It follows the format
`{your-organization}/{project-name}/{run-id}`, where `run-id` is a unique
8-character identifier.

Once you have your run path, evaluate the policy with:

```bash
uv run play \
    Mjlab-Spinkick-Unitree-G1 \
    --wandb-run-path {wandb-run-path} \
    --num-envs 8
```

## Deployment

We use
[motion_tracking_controller](https://github.com/HybridRobotics/motion_tracking_controller)
to deploy the trained policy. An ONNX file is provided for convenience, though
one will also be generated in your wandb artifacts. Download it and follow the
instructions in the motion_tracking_controller repo.

### Alternative Implementation

An alternative option is available through
[**RoboJuDo**](https://github.com/HansZ8/RoboJuDo), a lightweight deployment
framework designed for **onboard execution** and flexible modular integration.

RoboJuDo supports this mjlab example via the `BeyondmimicPolicy`, allowing
direct use of the provided configuration.

<details>
  <summary>A minimal configuration setup is shown below:</summary>

1. **Download** the ONNX model and place it in `assets/models/g1/beyondmimic`.

2. **Edit** the `g1_beyondmimic` config in `robojudo/config/g1/g1_cfg.py` to set
   policy name:

```python
@cfg_registry.register
class g1_beyondmimic(RlPipelineCfg):
    robot: str = "g1"
    env: G1MujocoEnvCfg = G1MujocoEnvCfg()
    ctrl: list[KeyboardCtrlCfg] = [KeyboardCtrlCfg()]

    policy: G1BeyondMimicPolicyCfg = G1BeyondMimicPolicyCfg(
        policy_name="spinkick_safe",
        max_timestep=183,
    )
```

3. For **real robot deployment**, you may use the `g1_locomimic_beyondmimic` or
   `g1_locomimic_beyondmimic_real` config in
   `robojudo/config/g1/g1_loco_mimic_cfg.py`, which includes smooth locomotion
   interpolation.
